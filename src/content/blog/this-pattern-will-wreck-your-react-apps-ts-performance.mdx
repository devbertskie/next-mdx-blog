A couple of years ago, Sentry were having big problems with their React app. They'd pretty recently [migrated it to TypeScript](https://blog.sentry.io/slow-and-steady-converting-sentrys-entire-frontend-to-typescript) from JavaScript. And the app was part of a large monorepo.

But the IDE performance was slow. You'd often need to wait a couple of seconds after making a change for the TypeScript language server to update. And running `tsc` would take a long time.

Now, this isn't unusual for a large TypeScript codebase. But the Sentry team had a hunch that something was wrong. The problem felt out of proportion to the size of the codebase.

It turned out that the issue, outlined by [Jonas](https://twitter.com/JonasBadalic/status/1765006152150974919), was down to a single pattern.

## How To Tank Your React App's TS Performance

In tons of places in Sentry's codebase, they were extending HTML types in React. For instance, defining `ButtonProps` would look like this:

```ts
import React from "react";

type ButtonProps =
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> & {
    extraProp: string;
  };

const Button = ({ extraProp, ...props }: ButtonProps) => {
  console.log(extraProp);
  return <button {...props} />;
};
```

This means that you could pass in all the props that a `<button>` element could take, plus an `extraProp`:

```ts
<Button
  extraProp="whatever"
  onClick={(e) => {

(parameter) e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>
  }}
/>;
```

But it turns out that this pattern is devilishly slow. So Jonas, following the advice of the [TypeScript Performance Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance), changed each of these to use an `interface` instead:

```ts
import React from "react";

interface ButtonProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  extraProp: string;
}
```

Suddenly, things got a lot snappier. The TypeScript language server was faster, and tsc ran quicker. Just from a little syntax change. Why?

## Why did this happens

You may have heard that `interface` is slightly faster than `type`. This is not quite true. In fact, `interface extends` is slightly faster than `&`.

In an earlier version of this article, I'd posted an explanation based on some fuzzy thinking which, thanks to my old colleague [Mateusz Burzyński](https://twitter.com/AndaristRake), I now understand was wrong.

The problem is more complex than I realised - check out [this thread](https://twitter.com/AndaristRake/status/1770743549325115459) for his critiques and our investigations.

Hopefully, I can update this article again with a definitive description of why this happens - but nothing is simple when it comes to TypeScript performance.

Suffice to say - `interface extends` is generally faster than `&`, and so it proved in this case too.
